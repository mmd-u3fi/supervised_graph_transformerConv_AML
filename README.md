# supervised_graph_transformerConv_AML
This notebook demonstrates the potential of graph transformer architecture for detecting suspicious accounts based on their transactions.
Dataset is a synthetic transactions graph made by AMLSIM. 

Dataset consists of ~ 800k Transactions
                    ~ 20k Accounts
                    
Network is optimized to classify ndoes based on their transactional behavior into Suspicious (Fraud) or Normal
